* This video describes what role regulation can play if there is only one firm in the market:

`part 1 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/83e2dce77d974c2588be87ca91201e781d>`_

* We take a look at a model of a regulated firm, starting with the underlying assumptions and payoffs:

`part 2 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/88c903d4cd7640869b7ef3a42e13e5e11d>`_

* We study first best, the case of no asymmetric information:

`part 3 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/b26f8508b33441bdaf334c6de7a542261d>`_

* Followed by the second best, the case where the regulator does not know how efficient the firm is (asymmetric information):

`part 4 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/0558b8cf647d4a99b946156bca8163281d>`_

* We simplify the planner's optimization problem:

`part 5 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/7e386e572a394bf2a5e4a03ce9ca5a101d>`_

* We find the optimal cost levels and discuss the competition increasing policy option to threaten the firm to shut down: 

`part 6 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/c86cdfcbc5334837aec43235e6c5838c1d>`_

* In this video we discuss the competition increasing policy option of yardstick competition:

`part 7 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/e3e7643b667e4d18a493ab3d90b6effb1d>`_

* Last, we shortly discuss policy implications of this lecture:

`part 8 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/d77b682dd5034ef5ac1766a35cba26b01d>`_
