Python: merger simulations
==========================

In this notebook we introduce a simple model to do merger simulations.
The analysis here is based on `Epstein and Rubinfeld
(2001) <http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2362&context=facpubs>`__.

The advantage of this approach is that the model can be calibrated with
relatively little information. In particular, we need to know

-  the market shares of the firms in the relevant market,
-  elasticity of market demand,
-  own price elasticity for one firm and
-  efficiency gains (claimed by firms).

Once, we know these things, we can simulate the market outcome before
and after the merger. If we do not know one or more parameters, we can
do sensitivity analysis: simply let the parameter run over a vector of
values.

what is the use of merger simulation?
-------------------------------------

Merger simulation is not a crystal ball! Economists cannot predict the
future. By applying a model to the data that we have, we can think about
the problem (effects of the merger, in this case) in a more structured
way. In particular, we can think about the merger in a way that others
can replicate.

However, every model makes assumptions and if these assumptions do not
apply, the outcome of the model will be incorrect. In other words, the
predictions of the model need to be handled with care.

The model that we use here, makes the following assumptions:

-  

   (P) Proportionality: if a firm raises its price, it loses market
       share; this lost market share is allocated to the other firms in
       the industry proportionally to these firms' market shares

-  

   (H) Homogeneity: if all firms in the market raise their price by the
       same percentage, market shares are unaffected

-  

   (A) Adding-up: market shares of all firms (brands) in the market add
       up to 1.

Although these assumptions are not unreasonable, they are not "innocent"
either.

First, we import some libraries that we will use:

.. code:: python

    from scipy import optimize,arange
    from numpy import array
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from math import log
    %matplotlib inline

demand
------

In this notebook we assume that there are 3 firms in the market, named
"firm\_1, firm\_2, firm\_3". If you use this notebook for a real case,
make sure you call the firms by their name, like "microsoft, google,
facebook" etc. This makes the code more readable than working with firms
1,2,3 and forcing the reader at each step to remember that firm 1 was
supposed to be microsoft.

The market share of firm :math:`i` is defined as
:math:`s_i = \frac{p_i q_i}{P Q}`, where :math:`p_i` denotes :math:`i`'s
price, :math:`q_i` its quantity, :math:`Q` total output on the market
and :math:`P` the aggregate industry price index. We assume that this
price index is given by :math:`\ln(P)=\sum_{i=1}^3 s_i \ln(p_i)`.

Firm :math:`i`'s demand in this model is written in terms of its market
share:

.. math::


   (D) \hspace{5mm} s_i = a_i + b_{ii} \ln(p_i) + b_{ij} \ln(p_j) + b_{ik} \ln(p_k)

calibration
-----------

Although this demand structure is a bit unusual, it has the following
useful property:

-  if we know

   -  market demand elasticity
      :math:`\varepsilon = \frac{d \ln(Q)}{d \ln (P)}`
   -  one firm's own price elasticity
      :math:`\varepsilon_{ii} = \frac{d \ln(q_i)}{d \ln (p_i)}`
   -  market shares :math:`s_i \geq 0` for :math:`i=1,...,n` with
      :math:`\sum_{i=1}^n s_i =1`

-  if we are willing to assume (P), (H) and (A)

-  then we know all coefficients :math:`b_{ij}` and demand elasticities
   :math:`\varepsilon_{ij}`

See the paper for a proof.

One way to find firm :math:`i`'s own price elasticity is to estimate
:math:`i`'s price cost margin, :math:`\mu_i`. Since firms set their
price (cost margin) satisfying :math:`\mu_i = -1/\varepsilon_{ii}`, we
know :math:`\varepsilon_{ii}` if we know the price cost margin.

If you do not know a parameter very well, then define an interval for it
and do the merger simulation for each value in the interval. This will
give you a good idea of how sensitive the simulation is for the value of
this parameter.

illustration
------------

As an illustration of how a merger simulation works, we will replicate
the example in table 1 on page 895 of Epstein and Rubinfeld (2001).

Don't worry about this class definition, we use it below to get decent
tables with results in the notebook.

.. code:: python

    class ListTable(list):
        """ Overridden list class which takes a 2-dimensional list of
            the form [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], and renders an HTML Table in
            IPython Notebook. """
    
        def _repr_html_(self):
            html = ["<table>"]
            for row in self:
                html.append("<tr>")
    
                for col in row:
                    html.append("<td>{0}</td>".format(col))
    
                html.append("</tr>")
            html.append("</table>")
            return ''.join(html)

We create python dictionaries for firms' market shares and elasticities.
In this way, we can refer to firm 1's market share as
``market_share['firm1']``. We check that the market shares are all
between 0 and 1. Further, a firm's own price elasticity is always larger
(in absolute value) than the demand elasticity. Indeed, when a firm
raises its price by 1%, a consumer can either not buy the product at all
or buy it from another firm.

The equations for the price elasticities are derived in the paper:

.. math::


   (E) \hspace{5mm} e_{ij} = \begin{cases}
   -1 + \frac{b_{ii}}{s_i} + s_i*(\varepsilon +1) & \text{ if } i=j \\
   \frac{b_{ij}}{s_i} + s_j* (\varepsilon +1) & \text{ otherwise }
   \end{cases}

If you use this file to do your own merger simulation, adjust the values
below.

.. code:: python

    market_share = {} # creates a dictionary with market shares
    elasticity = {}   # dictionaries of firm level own and cross elasticities
    
    firms = ['firm1','firm2','firm3'] # names of the firms in a python list
    market_share['firm2'] = 0.3
    market_share['firm3'] = 0.5
    market_share['firm1'] = 1 - sum(market_share[firm] for firm in ['firm2','firm3'])
    
    for firm in firms:
        if (market_share[firm] >= 0 and market_share[firm] <= 1):
            print "market share of firm: "+ firm + " is given by %1.2f" % market_share[firm]
        else: print "something wrong with the market share of the firm: "+firm
    
    market_elasticity = -1.0 # market demand elasticity
    elasticity['firm1','firm1'] = -3.0 # own elasticity of firm1
    
    if market_elasticity < elasticity['firm1','firm1']:
        print "error: a firm's own elasticity exceeds (in absolute value) the market elasticity"


.. parsed-literal::

    market share of firm: firm1 is given by 0.20
    market share of firm: firm2 is given by 0.30
    market share of firm: firm3 is given by 0.50


Now we can calculate the relevant parameters of the demand structure.
See the paper for the derivation of these expressions.

We create a dictionary to store the :math:`b_{ij}`-coefficients in
`demand system <#demand>`__ (D) above. Using the :math:`b_{ij}`'s, we
calculate the firm level (own and cross) elasticities :math:`e_{ij}`.
The assumption is that the :math:`b_{ij}`-coefficients are exogenous,
i.e. do not change after the merger.

As the merger affects firms' market shares, it does change the firm
elasticities.

.. code:: python

    b = {} # dictionary of b-coefficients of demand system (D) above 
    b['firm1','firm1'] = market_share['firm1']*(elasticity['firm1','firm1']+1-market_share['firm1']*(market_elasticity+1))
    
    for firm in firms:
        b[firm,firm]=(market_share[firm]*(1-market_share[firm]))/(market_share['firm1']*(1-market_share['firm1']))*b['firm1','firm1']
    
    for one_firm in firms:
        for other_firm in firms:
            if one_firm == other_firm:
                b[one_firm,one_firm]=(market_share[one_firm]*(1-market_share[one_firm]))/(market_share['firm1']*(1-market_share['firm1']))*b['firm1','firm1']
            else:
                b[one_firm,other_firm] = - market_share[one_firm]/(1-market_share[other_firm])*b[other_firm,other_firm]
                
    for one_firm in firms:
        for other_firm in firms:
            if one_firm == other_firm:
                elasticity[one_firm,one_firm] = -1 + b[one_firm,one_firm]/market_share[one_firm]+market_share[one_firm]*(market_elasticity+1)
            else:
                elasticity[one_firm,other_firm] = b[one_firm,other_firm]/market_share[one_firm]+market_share[other_firm]*(market_elasticity+1)
    
    table = ListTable()
    table.append(['b-coeff.', 'firm1','firm2','firm3'])
    for one_firm in firms:
        row = []
        row.append(one_firm)
        for other_firm in firms:
            row.append("%0.3f" % b[one_firm,other_firm])
        table.append(row)
    print "table of b coefficients:"
    table

A profit maximizing firm :math:`i` sets its margin equal to
:math:`\mu_i = -1/e_{ii}`. This can be derived as follows. A firm
chooses its price level :math:`p_i` to maximize profits:

.. math::


   \pi_i = p_i q_i(p_i,p_{-i}) - c_i(q_i(p_i,p_{-i}))

First order condition can be written as

.. math::


   q_i + (p_i - c_q) \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p_i} = 0

which can be written as

.. math::


   \mu_i = \frac{p_i - c_q}{p_i} = \frac{dp_i}{dq_i} \frac{q_i}{p_i} = \frac{-1}{e_{ii}}

Hence we can calculate the margin for each firm as follows:

.. code:: python

    margin = {}
    for firm in firms:
        margin[firm] = -1.0/elasticity[firm,firm]
        


The paper shows that the ex post merger outcome in terms of market
share, :math:`s_j^p`, price cost margin, :math:`\mu_j^p`, and price
change :math:`\delta_j = \frac{p_j^p - p_j}{p_j}` (9 variables with 3
firms) satisfies the following 9 equations:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{eqnarray}
   s_i^p &=& s_i + b_{i1}\ln(1+ \delta_1) +  b_{i2} \ln(1+ \delta_2) +  b_{i3}\ln(1+ \delta_3) ~\text{for } i=1,2,3\\ \mu_3^p &=& -1/\varepsilon_{33}^p ~\text{for the non merging firm} \\
   s_j^p &=&  -\varepsilon_{jj}^p s_j^p \mu_j^p -\varepsilon_{kj}^p s_k^p \mu_k^p ~\text{for the merging firms} j,k =1,2, j \neq k \\
   \mu_i^p &=& 1- \frac{1+\gamma_i}{1+\delta_i} (1-\mu_i)  ~\text{for } i=1,2,3
   \end{eqnarray}

where the efficiency gain is defined as

.. math::


   \gamma_i = \frac{c_i^p-c_i}{c_i}

the percentage change in :math:`i`'s costs :math:`c_i` due to the
merger.

In addition we have the elasticity equations (E) above with post-merger
market shares, denoted :math:`s_j^p`.

Details are in the paper, we give a sketch of the proof of the equations
above. The equation for :math:`s_i^p` follows from writing the (D)
equations for both :math:`s_i` --as above-- and for :math:`s_i^p`. Then
take the difference of these equations and note that
:math:`1+\delta_i=p^p_i/p_i` and
:math:`\ln(p_i^p)-\ln(p_i)=\ln(1+\delta_i)`.

For the non merging firm we have :math:`\mu_3 = -1/e_{33}^p` as before.
Now, consider the first order condition for :math:`p_j` for the merged
firm (consisting of :math:`j` and :math:`k`):

.. math::


   \frac{\partial q_j}{\partial p_j} (p_j - c_j) + q_j + \frac{\partial q_k}{\partial p_j} (p_k - c_k)

which can be rewritten as

.. math::


   s_j^p =  -\varepsilon_{jj}^p s_j^p \mu_j^p -\varepsilon_{kj}^p s_k^p \mu_k^p

Finally, the expression for :math:`\mu_i^p` follows from the definitions
of :math:`\gamma_i,\delta_i` and :math:`\mu_i`.

.. code:: python

    merging_firms = ['firm1','firm2']                      # list of the merging firms
    nonmerging_firms = list(set(firms)-set(merging_firms)) # list of non-merging firms
    efficiency_gains = {} # dictionary with efficiency gains --due to the merger-- for the firms
    for firm in merging_firms:
        efficiency_gains[firm] = 0.0
    for firm in nonmerging_firms:
        efficiency_gains[firm] = 0.0

We create dictionaries for post merger market shares (:math:`s_i^p`),
elasticities (:math:`e_{ij}^p`), margins (:math:`\mu_i^p`) and price
changes (:math:`\delta_i`). Then we create a vector function with all
the equations above. We look for the values of
:math:`s_i^p,e_{ij}^p,\mu_i^p,\delta_i` such that this vector function
equals zero (all equations are satisfied).

We form a list of equations and append it with new equations. For a
given guess of the values :math:`s_i^p,e_{ij}^p,\mu_i^p,\delta_i`
``equations`` returns the extent to which the equations are satisfied.
If ``equations``\ =0, all equations are satisfied and we find the post
merger equilibrium.

.. code:: python

    post_marketshare = {}
    post_elasticity = {}
    post_margin = {}
    price_change = {}
    
    def vector_function(post_marketshare,post_elasticity,post_margin,price_change):
        equations = []
        for firm in sorted(firms):
            equations.append(post_marketshare[firm]-(market_share[firm]+sum([b[firm,other_firm]*log(1+price_change[other_firm]) for other_firm in firms])))
            equations.append(post_margin[firm] - (1-(1+efficiency_gains[firm])/(1+price_change[firm])*(1-margin[firm])))
        for firm in sorted(nonmerging_firms):
            equations.append(post_margin[firm] + 1/post_elasticity[firm,firm])
            equations.append(post_elasticity[firm,firm] - (-1 + b[firm,firm]/post_marketshare[firm]+post_marketshare[firm]*(market_elasticity+1)))
        for firm in sorted(merging_firms):
            equations.append(post_marketshare[firm]+sum(post_elasticity[other_firm,firm]*post_marketshare[other_firm]*post_margin[other_firm] for other_firm in sorted(merging_firms)))
            for other_firm in sorted(merging_firms):
                equations.append(post_elasticity[firm,other_firm] - (-(firm==other_firm) + b[firm,other_firm]/post_marketshare[firm]+post_marketshare[other_firm]*(market_elasticity+1)))
        return equations    

As the solver works with a vector :math:`x` for the values (not a
collection of dictionaries), we define a wrapper function which turns
:math:`x` to the values in the dictionaries. Once we have the solution
:math:`x` we 'unwrap' it into values for our dictionaries.

.. code:: python

    def wrapper_function(x): # the solver used below needs a vector x as input, not a collection of dictionaries
        counter = 0
        for dict in [post_marketshare,post_margin,price_change]:
            for firm in sorted(firms):
                dict[firm] = x[counter]
                counter +=1
        for firm in sorted(nonmerging_firms):
            post_elasticity[firm, firm] = x[counter]
            counter +=1
        for firm in sorted(merging_firms):
            for other_firm in sorted(merging_firms):
                post_elasticity[firm, other_firm] = x[counter]
                counter +=1
        return vector_function(post_marketshare,post_elasticity,post_margin,price_change)
    
    def unwrap(x):   # once we have the equilibrium solution as a vector x, we go back to dictionaries 
        counter = 0  # as they are easier to work with
        for dict in [post_marketshare,post_margin,price_change]:
            for firm in sorted(firms):
                dict[firm] = x[counter]
                counter +=1
        for firm in sorted(nonmerging_firms):
            post_elasticity[firm, firm] = x[counter]
            counter +=1
        for firm in sorted(merging_firms):
            for other_firm in sorted(merging_firms):
                post_elasticity[firm, other_firm] = x[counter]
                counter +=1
        return [post_marketshare,post_elasticity,post_margin,price_change]

The solver needs an initial guess for the post merger solution; we use
the pre-merger values as initial guess.

.. code:: python

    def initial_value(): # initial value based on before merger values
        x = []
        for dict in [market_share,margin]:
            for firm in sorted(firms):
                x.append(dict[firm])
        for firm in sorted(firms):
            x.append(0.0) # price change
        for firm in sorted(nonmerging_firms):
            x.append(elasticity[firm, firm])
        for firm in sorted(merging_firms):
            for other_firm in sorted(merging_firms):
                x.append(elasticity[firm, other_firm])
        return x    

We use the ``fsolve`` routine to find the values where
``vector_function`` equals 0 (where all equations hold). We solve this
"via" ``wrapper_function`` as ``fsolve`` expects a vector :math:`x` as
input, not a list of dictionaries. We print the relevant post merger
values in a table.

.. code:: python

    def after_merger_values():
        outcome = unwrap(optimize.fsolve(wrapper_function, initial_value()))
        table = ListTable()
        table.append(['firm', 'marketshare','margin','price increase'])
        for firm in firms:
            table.append([firm, "%0.3f" % outcome[0][firm],"%0.3f" % outcome[2][firm],"%0.3f" % outcome[3][firm]])
        print "table of post merger outcomes:"
        return table            

.. code:: python

    after_merger_values()


.. parsed-literal::

    table of post merger outcomes:




.. raw:: html

    <table><tr><td>firm</td><td>marketshare</td><td>margin</td><td>price increase</td></tr><tr><td>firm1</td><td>0.174</td><td>0.414</td><td>0.138</td></tr><tr><td>firm2</td><td>0.281</td><td>0.425</td><td>0.108</td></tr><tr><td>firm3</td><td>0.546</td><td>0.466</td><td>0.041</td></tr></table>



As one would expect, a merger between firms producing substitutes with
no efficiency gains leads to higher prices for all firms. The market
share of the firm that does not merge (firm3) increases due to the
merger as prices increase more for the merging firms.
