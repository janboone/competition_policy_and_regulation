* This video points out the importance of the relation between competition and innovation, and takes a look at ex ante vs ex post competition:

`part 1 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/0a7abacbf74d4bf38856e4818b6032741d>`_

* We study a model where competition raises innovation if firms maximize profits (company ran by owners) and if firms are ran by managers:

`part 2 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/73377350bf61420396c850b483428e811d>`_

* In this video arguments against the positive relation between competition and innovation are provided by the inverted U duopoly model by Aghion et al. (2005) and the Schumpeter argument:

`part 3 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/bf0661db0e7e4c21a491d7b8622977f01d>`_

* We study the duopoly model by Segal and Whinston (2007), which questions whether competition policy should be different in innovative industries:

`part 4 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/80aa80de215246a7a513aa4a05afc06b1d>`_

* We continue studying the model by Segal and Whinston (2007):

`part 5 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/6bc422ac11e740619bd41b793275eaab1d>`_

* This video shows how exclusion can be modeled and provides policy implications of the models studied so far: 

`part 6 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/a4c6d64558c646b483fd0c70b355dbc51d>`_

* We discuss take a first look at intellectual property rights, study current US law and trade secrecy:

`part 7 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/5c6c16a797f644b7ad8dde0b706e2f841d>`_

* We consider a model that explains the trade off between optimal patent duration and breadth:

`part 8 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/79fb87888ae8484ea79e55fdcd0d41811d>`_

* Last we consider a model that derives the optimal profitability of patents and conclude with policy implications:

`part 9 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/04e20527177c4dde8bd7943c2d2b66251d>`_
`part 10 <https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/726624e40244438f83e27788e6b997b01d>`_
