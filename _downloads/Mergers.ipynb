    "# Python: merger simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we introduce a simple model to do merger simulations. The analysis here is based on [Epstein and Rubinfeld (2001)](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2362&context=facpubs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this approach is that the model can be calibrated with relatively little information. In particular, we need to know \n",

    "* the market shares of the firms in the relevant market,\n",
    "* elasticity of market demand,\n",
    "* own price elasticity for one firm and\n",
    "* efficiency gains (claimed by firms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once, we know these things, we can simulate the market outcome before and after the merger. If we do not know one or more parameters, we can do sensitivity analysis: simply let the parameter run over a vector of values.\n",

    "## what is the use of merger simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Merger simulation is not a crystal ball! Economists cannot predict the future. By applying a model to the data that we have, we can think about the problem (effects of the merger, in this case) in a more structured way. In particular, we can think about the merger in a way that others can replicate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, every model makes assumptions and if these assumptions do not apply, the outcome of the model will be incorrect. In other words, the predictions of the model need to be handled with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that we use here, makes the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (P) Proportionality: if a firm raises its price, it loses market share; this lost market share is allocated to the other firms in the industry proportionally to these firms' market shares\n",
    "* (H) Homogeneity: if all firms in the market raise their price by the same percentage, market shares are unaffected\n",
    "* (A) Adding-up: market shares of all firms (brands) in the market add up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these assumptions are not unreasonable, they are not \"innocent\" either.\n",
